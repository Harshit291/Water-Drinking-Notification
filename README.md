# Water-Drinking-Notification
This is an app built in PYTHON, which notify me to drink water to keep 
my body hydrated.

I used notification from plyer module.

I have used time.sleep() to stop it for 1 hour.
You can use windows scheduler for scheduling this program accordingly.
OR
you can run it in background, using - pythonw ./main.py
